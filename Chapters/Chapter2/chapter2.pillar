!!What we are talking about

!!!Illustration example

!!!Evaluation criteria

- constraints: make a list and evaluate all solutions?
- flexibility: no constraint on the source code
- granularity: method, AST, other?
- integration: is it integrated into the system?
- self preservation: case of proxies?


!!!Performance overhead evaluation
- source code with instrumentation example
- describe the used method
- describe the limitations of the method
