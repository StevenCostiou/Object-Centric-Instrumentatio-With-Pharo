\chapter{Introduction}
This booklet is about object-centric instrumentation in Pharo. An instrumentation is object-centric if it applies to one specific object (or a set of objects), without consideration of its class. It means the instrumentation can be applied on one object, leaving untouched all other instances of its class, or to an heterogeneous set of instances of different classes. This booklet gives an overview of available object-centric instrumentation techniques in Pharo, either present in the standard distribution or available on download. We will not go into deep technical usage description, nor into implementation details. Each chapter illustrates one solution with examples, and gives the necessary references if one wants to go deeper in the study of the solution. Each solution is evaluated against a set of criteria presented in Chapter 2, along with a short performance overhead evaluation.
